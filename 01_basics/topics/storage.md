# Storage 

Storage is a critical component in any system architecture. It determines how and where data is stored, accessed, and managed. Choosing the right type of storage affects performance, scalability, cost, and reliability.

## üì¶ Types of Storage

| Storage Type     | Description                                     | Examples                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Block Storage    | Stores data in fixed-size blocks, like hard drives | Amazon EBS, SAN, iSCSI            |
| File Storage     | Stores data as files in a hierarchical structure | Amazon EFS, NFS, SMB              |
| Object Storage   | Stores data as objects with metadata and unique IDs | Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage   |
| In-Memory Cache  | Temporarily stores frequently accessed data in RAM | Redis, Memcached                  |
| Distributed Storage | Stores data across multiple nodes/systems      | HDFS, Ceph, Cassandra             |

## üß± Storage Access Models

| Model          | Description                                | Common Use Case                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Local Storage  | Tied directly to a single server/machine    | Logs, temporary files               |
| Network Storage| Shared across multiple servers              | Shared file systems, backups        |
| Cloud Storage  | Accessible via APIs over the internet       | Scalable media, user uploads        |

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Characteristics

| Characteristic    | Description                                             |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Durability        | Likelihood that data remains intact over time          |
| Availability      | Data is accessible when needed                         |
| Scalability       | System can grow to handle more data                    |
| Latency           | Time to retrieve or store data                         |
| Throughput        | Amount of data processed per time unit                 |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Choosing the Right Storage

| Use Case                        | Recommended Storage Type       |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Frequently accessed data         | In-memory cache (Redis)       |
| Large unstructured files         | Object storage (S3)           |
| Shared document storage          | File storage (EFS, NFS)       |
| High-speed database transactions | Block storage (EBS)           |
| Scalable log/data lakes          | Distributed storage (HDFS)    |

## üß© Storage Design Considerations

- **Latency Requirements**: In-memory and SSDs offer lowest latency.
- **Consistency**: Choose between strong, eventual, or tunable consistency.
- **Cost**: In-memory and block storage are more expensive than object storage.
- **Access Patterns**: Read-heavy vs write-heavy vs balanced.
- **Backup & Recovery**: Plan for snapshotting, replication, versioning.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use **object storage** for scalability and durability.
- Implement **caching layers** to reduce storage read load.
- Enable **replication and backups** for critical data.
- Use **cold/hot storage tiers** to optimize cost vs performance.
- Monitor **I/O performance metrics** regularly.

## üìö Summary

Storage choices in system design must balance **speed**, **cost**, **durability**, and **scalability**. Different types serve different needs‚Äîfrom high-speed transaction logs to cost-efficient archival storage. A layered approach is often best: cache ‚Üí fast storage ‚Üí archival storage.
